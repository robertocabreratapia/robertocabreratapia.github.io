<h1 class="firstheader">About</h1>
<p>I am a political scientist at the <a href="https://www.dzsf.bund.de">German Centre for Rail Traffic Research</a> (DZSF). My main work areas are research management and strategic planning in the field of rail traffic. My own research is related to politics of transportation and mobility, with a regional focus on Germany and the European Union. Additionally, I am an adjunct lecturer at <a href="http://www.uni-due.de">University of Duisburg-Essen</a> and <a href="https://www.hsrw.org">Rhine-Waal University</a> and serve as scientific advisor for the BMBF-funded research project <a href="https://fanzine-research.github.io">FANZinE - Football as basis for social cohesion in Europe</a>.</p>

<p>From 2018-2021 I was the project manager of the <a href="http://gepris.dfg.de/gepris/projekt/386268084">DFG</a> research project <a href="https://eufoot.github.io">The Identity Effect of Europeanized Lifeworlds: Becoming European via Football</a> at <a href="https://www.hsrw.org">Rhine-Waal University</a> and <a href="https://www.uni-mainz.de">University of Mainz</a>. My previous work includes positions as senior advisor to the <a href="http://www.boeckler.de">Hans Böckler Foundation</a>, as researcher at <a href="http://www.uni-due.de">University of Duisburg-Essen</a> and as lecturer at <a href="http://www.rwth.de">RWTH Aachen University</a>. I regularly teach methodology in social sciences and classes in the area of political participation, political organisations, and policy research. I am trained in diversity oriented career coaching, peer coaching and in solution-focused counseling with a special focus on students and young researchers.</p>

<p>I have studied political science and history (2003-2010) at the universities of Aachen, Prague and Potsdam. In 2017, I obtained my PhD with a work on <a href="https://duepublico2.uni-due.de/servlets/MCRFileNodeServlet/duepublico_derivate_00043836/WeberRegina_Diss.pdf" target=_blank>Young people in old politics</a> from the Faculty of Social Sciences at the University of Duisburg-Essen (supervised by <a href="http://achimgoerres.de">Prof. Dr Achim Goerres</a>).</p>
