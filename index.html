<h1>About</h1>
<p>I am a political scientist at the <a href="https://www.dzsf.bund.de">German Centre for Rail Traffic Research</a> (DZSF) in Bonn. My work areas are research management in the field of rail traffic and research related to political participation and mobility. Additionally, I am an adjunct lecturer at <a href="http://www.uni-due.de">University of Duisburg-Essen</a> and <a href="https://www.hsrw.org">Rhine-Waal University</a> and serve as scientific advisor for the BMBF-funded research project <a href="https://fanzine-research.github.io">FANZinE - Football as basis for social cohesion in Europe</a>.</p>

<p>From 2018-2021 I was a postdoctoral researcher and project manager in the <a href="http://gepris.dfg.de/gepris/projekt/386268084">DFG</a> research project <a href="https://eufoot.github.io">The Identity Effect of Europeanized Lifeworlds: Becoming European via Football</a> at <a href="https://www.hsrw.org">Rhine-Waal University</a> and <a href="https://www.uni-mainz.de">University of Mainz</a>.

I regularly teach methodology in social sciences and classes in the area of political participation, political organisations, and policy research.
